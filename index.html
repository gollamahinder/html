Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California, United States.
 Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, 
solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of 
battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market 
>(which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market.
 Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems 
in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems,
 with 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2020.
Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to 
inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment,
 X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and its chairman. He has served as
 CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy,
 obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster, 
in 2009. This was followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in 2015, the Tesla Model 3
 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in 
electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.
 Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year.
Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and acts of 
CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, 
and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the National Highway
 Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with
 Autopilot.

Tesla’s now famous Induction motor and Inverter combination give it a unique set of qualities.
 Invented more than a century ago by the American-Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla, the Induction motor uses a 
three-phase alternating current in the coil to produce a rotating magnetic field. This rotating magnetic field or
 RMF induces a current on the rotor that helps make it spin. In an induction motor, the speeds depend on the 
frequency of the alternating current supplied. So,up the frequency, and the speed at which the motor
 turns can be increased, and that makes controlling the drive speed easy. The induction motor, importantly,
 has no permanent magnet.
Power for the electric motor comes from a battery pack. Tesla uses cylindrical type cells, 
similar in basic construction to pencil cells, where positive and negative electrode are placed in layers,
 and then rolled together. Separators and casings keeping the various layers apart.
DC power from the battery pack then flows to the inverter, which converts it to AC for use by the induction motor.
 The inverter also controls the motor speed. Increase the amplitude of the current and the induction motor can even
 be made to produce more power; giving it a unique advantage.plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market

Tesla Inc., the world’s most valuable automaker, is all set to enter the Indian market in 2021. According to a report in ET Auto,
 the US electric vehicle giant will bring its best-selling and most affordable Model 3 here by end of first quarter of FY 2021-22.
 While the deliveries will begin later, the bookings for the electric sedan will commence in India from next month
In October, CEO Elon Musk had tweeted about the company’s entry in India in 2021.
Though the company had initially planned to launch the Model 3 here in 2017, with its pre-bookings opened in 2016, the EV maker delayed its
 plans because of India's import policy and inadequate infrastructure, as per the report. However, the plan seems to be taking off now.
Just like in international markets, Tesla is expected to follow the direct sales model in India as well. The company will bank upon digital sales,
 without appointing any dealers here. The cars will be imported via the completely built unit (CBU) route and is likely to be priced from ?55 lakh onwards.
 According to the company’s results in the 3rd quarter of 2020, the Tesla Model 3 along with the Model Y accounted for 89% of the total sales
plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market 
>(which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market.

It’s official; Tesla is finally headed to India. Confirmation of the same was put out by rocket-man and CEO, Elon Musk, via Twitter.
The Indian company is in the process of being incorporated in Bengaluru, and is looking at various locations to set up its manufacturing plant.
 Gujarat is one such location being considered, and there are a bunch of others too.
The move to setup the company’s India operations have been a long time coming. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Tesla plant in 2015, 
and Musk started his dalliance with India in 2017, when Tesla accepted booking amounts for the Model 3 from Indian customers.
The need for India to move to a more electric car dependent transport structure is an obvious one. As long as the move is natural,
 not forced and non-disruptive, the benefits are likely to be huge. And with sales of luxury cars increasing steadily, Tesla could be moving in at just
 the right time. But where exactly will Tesla setup its plant and when will India’s assembled cars begin rolling off the production line? We’ll have the
 answers soon.
